## How this was initially created

### amd64 version

I ran the following commands on an amd64 host

runc spec
mkdir rootfs
docker run --name container-to-export -d alpine sleep 99999
docker export container-to-export | tar x -C rootfs
docker rm -f container-to-export

# edit config.json and change:
# 1. process.args from ["sh"] to ["sh", "-c", "echo hello && hostname"]
# 2. terminal to false
# 3. remove XTERM from env

## Running the test

docker build -tag testrunc .
docker run --rm --privileged testrunc

### arm64

The same steps above were run, except with a `docker run --platform linux/arm64` was used to
both create the rootfs and during the build and run commands of the test. This was done on a amd64-based host
with qemu, for example:

runc spec
mkdir rootfs
docker run --name container-to-export -d --platform linux/arm64 alpine sleep 99999
docker export container-to-export | tar x -C rootfs
docker rm -f container-to-export

# edit config.json and change:
# 1. process.args from ["sh"] to ["sh", "-c", "echo hello && hostname"]
# 2. terminal to false
# 3. remove XTERM from env

## Running the test

docker build --platform linux/arm64 -tag testrunc .
docker run --rm --privileged --platform linux/arm64 testrunc
